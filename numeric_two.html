            <p>We're going to change it up just for this page and explore a different data set. This data set is fake,
                but resembles some real data sets that I worked with. The data describes bacterial communities you might
                find in a person's lungs, specifically a person with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) or Chronic Obstructive
                Pulmonary Disease (COPD). These are both chronic respiratory conditions that often have co-occuring
                and persistent bacterial lung infections. We want to know if the bacteria in the lungs look different
                for people with CF versus COPD. Each variable is the name of a type of Bacteria and the values are the
                percentage of that bacterial type we found out of the total. One thing to know is that bacteria like to
                compete with each other for food and space.

                <h2>How do we explore relationships between two variables?</h2>

                <img src="image/scatter.svg" alt="scatterplots" class="scalesvg">

                <p>A <dfn>scatterplot</dfn> shows the relationship between two numeric variables - as one increases,
                    what does the other one do? The scatterplots show how Streptococcus and Veillonella populations vary
                    with each other. [Don't be scared of the variables, these are just names for organisms, like Turtles
                    and Lizards, you can think of them as those instead if you like.] The plot on the left shows all of
                    the data with the same color and marker. Notice that there are two groups. We also had two groups in
                    our study population. The plot on the right uses different colors and markers to show the CF and
                    COPD groups. Now we can see what's really going on: for individuals with CF, there just isn't much
                    of either type of bacteria; for individuals with COPD the more Streptococcus you have, the less
                    Veillonella you have and vice versa.

                <h2>What about more than two variables?</h2>

                <img src="image/pcp.svg" alt="par coords plot" class="scalesvg">

                <p>This plot looks pretty complicated! This <dfn>parallel coordinates plot</dfn> is showing the values
                    of five variables,five different types of bacteria side by side. The colors represent the CF and
                    COPD groups. Each line represents a single individual. What we are looking for is whether lines
                    group together in any sort of discernable pattern. We can see some clear patterns when we look at
                    all five variables together. Individuals with COPD tend to have a lot of Streptococcus,
                    and a bit less Prevotella and Veillonella. They donâ€™t have Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. CF
                    individuals fall into two groups: those with a lot of Pseudomonas and not much of anything else, and
                    those with a lot of Staphylococcus and not much of anything else.</p>
